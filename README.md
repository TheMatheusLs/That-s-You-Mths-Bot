# That's You Mths Telegram Bot

A Telegram Bot for the PS4 that's you game. This game is not for commercial purposes and I only created it to play with my friends during the Covid-19 pandemic. The PS4 game is excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the platform.

### How do I play?
- You need to have Python installed and the modules contained in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Once this is done, it is necessary to create the Bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
- After obtaining the API code, add it to the `settings.py` file in the constant `API_TOKEN`.
- After that, create your questions in a `.txt` file, one question for each line. With all this done, just execute the code and the Bot will be available on Telegram.
